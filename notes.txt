C# vs .NET

C# = programming language


.NET = framework for building apps on Windows
- CLR (Common Language Runtime)
    translates IL Code to machine code (Just-in-time compilation) JIT
- Class Library

#RANDOM FACTS:
Namespace = Container for related Classes
Assembly (DLL or EXE) = Container for related Namespaces, a file


#Language:
int number;

const float Pi = 3.14f; //const has to be initialized with a value. Cannot be changed.
			//use Capital letter when declaring constants
byte number = 2;
int count = 10;
float totalPrice = 20.95f;
char character = 'A';
string firstName = "Oscar";
bool isWorking = false;

var number = 2; //automatically assigns the value to int, as it is the standard for whole numbers
var number = 2.5; //automatically assigns the value to double, as it is the standard for decimal numbers

Console.WriteLine("{0} {1}, byte.MinValue, byte.MaxValue"); //template string, inserts the values into the brackets
